This program implements the classic Towers of Hanoi game using C and the PrimLib library for graphics. 
The objective of the game is to move all disks from the first peg to the last peg, following specific rules:

1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.
2. Each move consists of taking the top disk from one stack and placing it on top of another stack.
3. No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.
